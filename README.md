# MODULAR CAMPAIGN FRAMEWORK

## THE IDEA

The idea behind this framework is just that - a framework. It will provide a hub with fairly basic functionality, a mission selection screen, operator selection screen etc. 
and will count on mission makers to contribute missions as they see fit. An easy-to-follow campaign mission structure is key here, and integration should happen seamlessly.
It is in the very early stages, and as such is not currently playable.
